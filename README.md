Look up terms in Wikipedia without leaving your current page

Tell Me More is a Chrome extension to make Wikipedia lookups less painful. Once installed, users can select any text,
and a hovercard containing that text's Wikipedia entry will appear.

All extension materials are found in the 'extension' directory -- everything outside of that are materials for the
Chrome Extension Store.
