Context is a browser extension that gives you more information about anything you read online, no new tabs required. After selecting any text, Context will retrieve data about it and show that data to you in a hovering pane, right alongside the text you're reading.

Context currently only draws data from Freebase, but there are plans to expand to dictionary definitions, science blogs and Vox.com*.

Currently, Context is Chrome-only. While it is functional, it is not ready for use -- bugs are being fixed every day, and it will be available as an alpha soon. If you're interested is using or contributing to Context, email me at reed@outlook.com

*Vox integration is pending. While some features are underway, we're still talking with them re: permissions to pull Vox content.
